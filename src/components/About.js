      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a <strong>Certified Test Automation Engineer</strong> and <strong>Professional Scrum Master</strong> with 7 years of experience designing scalable test automation frameworks and backend systems. My technical toolkit includes <strong>Java, Spring Boot, Python, Cucumber, Jenkins, and SQL</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Africa’s development is often hindered not by a lack of talent or compassion, but by the absence of reliable data. Too many decisions are made in the dark—without records, without visibility, without justice. This challenge led me to backend engineering. I now build systems that don’t just store data—they capture truth, preserve dignity, and restore trust.
      </p>
      <p>
        My current mission is to build a sponsorship portal where every child’s story is recorded, every donation is traceable, and every sponsor can give with clarity and confidence. I believe backend systems can illuminate what’s hidden, empower communities, and build legacies rooted in integrity.
